Consequently, many people not directly in software engineering fields are starting to write more code, often in the form of interactive notebooks, such as Jupyter. Software engineers have typically been huge advocates of build systems, static analysis of code, and generating repeatable processes to enforce quality.

            " Noah previously worked for a startup called Score Sports, which used machine learning to uncover athlete influence on social media and internet platforms. We look into some of his findings in that role, including how to predict the impact of athletes’ social media engagement. We also discuss some of his more recent work in using social media to predict which players hold the most on-court value, and how this work could lead to more complete approaches to player valuation. Finally, we spend some time discussing some areas that Noah sees as ripe for new research and experimentation across sports, and we take a look at his upcoming book Pragmatic AI, An Introduction to Cloud-Based Machine Learning.

There are cloud-native technologies like serverless and cloud-legacy technologies like relational databases, which were first proposed in 1970. One easy way to note this distinction is to think about the cloud as the new operating system. Before there was the cloud, you had to write your application for Windows, Mac or some Unix/Linux flavor. After the cloud, you could either port your legacy application and legacy technologies, or you could design your application natively for the cloud.\n",

Recommendation engines are at the heart of the central feedback loop of social networks and the user-generated content (UGC) they create. Users join the network and are recommended users and content with which to engage. Recommendation engines can be gamed because they amplify the effects of thought bubbles. The 2016 US presidential election showed how important it is to understand how recommendation engines work and the limitations and strengths they offer.\n",
